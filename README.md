# Sahayak-Bot
In the early days, robots meant using actuators to enact human body movements. Today, robots are used to assist humans or to reduce human efforts rather than just mimicking humans. With massive development of AI and machine learning, robots are now capable of taking their own decisions. In-fact this introduction's sentence structure, grammar and spelling were checked and improved with the help of a ‘robot’. Astonishing, isn’t it? Robots are leaving the comforts of a controlled factory environment and moving to the unpredictable environment we inhabit. This ‘real-world environment’ holds many interesting and complex challenges for us engineers to explore and resolve.

Assistance robots are being massively used around the globe be it in the medical industry or the food business. Although significant progress has been made there is so much more to explore in a variety of fields. Assistance robots are presently seen in applications such as cleaning, gardening and entertainment. What if we could build a robot that can truly assist in your tasks just like a human-partner would. The applications for such a robot are limitless and are constrained only by the limits of our imagination.

This is the challenge we pose in e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC 2020-21) in a unique Theme titled Sahayak Bot. Here we help you unleash your imagination and discover your talent in programming an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) to make it capable of autonomously traversing an indoor environment to assist moving objects from one place to another. The scenario is that objects are being moved in e-Yantra’s lab and we are short of manpower so Sahayak bot is used to help move the boxes from one place to another. We divide the theme into a number of tasks to build the Sahayak Bot in a step- by-step manner making the process easier and more interesting for you.

Challenges in this theme include: 2D mapping, 3D mapping, Autonomous Navigation, Perception, Pick and Place.

After simulating the robot, we need to navigate it in the lab and move objects from their initial position to the goal location which is a box. The team that performs the task fastest with minimal penalties as per rules will be the winner. We believe this theme to be a novel way to get e-Yantra students to explore the field of mobile robotics and robotic manipulators.
